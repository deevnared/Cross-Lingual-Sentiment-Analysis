The project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying user reviews across multiple languages and categories (books, DVDs, music). The model is trained using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network known for its ability to effectively handle sequential data and capture long-range dependencies.
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. The dataset consists of user reviews collected from various sources, covering books, DVDs, and music across four languages: German, French, Japanese, and English.
The project aims to address challenges such as language complexity, data imbalance, and multilingual applicability to enhance the understanding of consumer sentiments and public opinion. By developing robust sentiment analysis tools, the project contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of natural language processing.
